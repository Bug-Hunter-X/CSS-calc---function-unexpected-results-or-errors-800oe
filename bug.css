The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be cases where it produces unexpected results if the operands are not correctly specified or if there are compatibility issues with older browsers. For instance, using spaces inconsistently around the operators or mixing units improperly can lead to parsing errors or incorrect calculations. Also, older browsers may not fully support the `calc()` function, leading to layout issues or unexpected behavior.
