Ensure that you use consistent spacing around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` function. Always place a space before and after each operator.   Also, make sure that you are using compatible units. You can't directly add or subtract different units (e.g., pixels and percentages) without converting them to a common unit. For better browser compatibility, consider providing fallback values or using alternative methods for calculations if needed. You can use variables or pre-calculated values to enhance readability and maintainability. For instance, instead of `width: calc(100% - 20px);`, consider creating a variable `--sidebar-width: 20px;` and then using `width: calc(100% - var(--sidebar-width));`.
